# AI for SDG 3: Predicting Diabetes Risk

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to support the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 â€” Good Health and Well-being**.  
The goal is to build a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on key health indicators such as glucose level, BMI, age, and blood pressure.  
Early detection through AI can enable better healthcare decisions and improve quality of life.

## Objective
Diabetes remains a global health challenge, often going undetected until it leads to severe complications.  
This project aims to:
- Use **supervised machine learning** to predict the likelihood of diabetes.  
- Provide a simple, accessible AI tool for **early risk assessment**.  
- Demonstrate how AI solutions can contribute to achieving **SDG 3**.
